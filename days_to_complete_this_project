## 7-Day Sprint Project Plan

---

## 📋 **Project Overview**
Build a comprehensive dashboard analyzing weather impacts on transportation, featuring predictive models for delays and accident risks with real-time recommendations.

---

## 🗓️ **Day-by-Day Breakdown**

### **Day 1** | Project Setup & Data Source Integration
**🎯 Goal:** Prepare environment, set up version control, and connect to APIs

#### ✅ Tasks:
- [ ] Create project folder & GitHub repository
- [ ] Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn requests scikit-learn plotly streamlit
  ```
- [ ] Obtain API keys for:
  - **Weather Data** → OpenWeather API / Weatherbit API
  - **Traffic Data** → Google Maps Traffic API / TomTom Traffic API  
  - **Public Transport API** (Optional - city specific)
- [ ] Test API calls and save sample JSON responses

---

### **Day 2** | Data Collection & Storage
**🎯 Goal:** Automate fetching and storing historical + real-time data

#### ✅ Tasks:
- [ ] Write Python scripts to pull:
  - Weather conditions + temperature + precipitation
  - Traffic congestion index, delays, average speed
  - Accident reports (if API available)
- [ ] Set up data storage (CSV or SQLite database)
- [ ] Schedule periodic data pulls using `schedule` or cron jobs

---

### **Day 3** | Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
**🎯 Goal:** Prepare clean datasets for analysis

#### ✅ Tasks:
- [ ] Handle missing values and data inconsistencies
- [ ] Convert timestamps to proper datetime format
- [ ] Merge weather data with transport data on time/date
- [ ] Categorize weather types (Sunny, Rainy, Foggy, Stormy)
- [ ] Normalize values like congestion index (0–1 scale)

---

### **Day 4** | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**🎯 Goal:** Identify trends & correlations

#### ✅ Tasks:
- [ ] Plot average delay vs. weather condition
- [ ] Analyze accident frequency in different weather types
- [ ] Check traffic congestion patterns by weather and time of day
- [ ] Create correlation matrices and statistical summaries
- [ ] Save all plots for final report/dashboard

---

### **Day 5** | Model Development
**🎯 Goal:** Build predictive models

#### ✅ Tasks:
- [ ] **Delay Prediction Model** → Regression (RandomForestRegressor / XGBoost)
- [ ] **Accident Risk Model** → Classification (Logistic Regression / RandomForestClassifier)
- [ ] Train models on historical data
- [ ] Evaluate performance using MAE, Accuracy, and other metrics
- [ ] Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance

---

### **Day 6** | Dashboard & Recommendations
**🎯 Goal:** Create user-friendly interface with actionable insights

#### ✅ Tasks:
- [ ] Build Streamlit/Dash dashboard featuring:
  - Real-time transport delay forecast
  - Accident risk levels (Low, Medium, High)
  - Interactive congestion pattern graphs
  - Recommended travel times & optimal routes
- [ ] Add "Next 24 hours" forecast section
- [ ] Implement user-friendly navigation and filters

---

### **Day 7** | Testing & Deployment
**🎯 Goal:** Final polish and go live

#### ✅ Tasks:
- [ ] Test predictions with real-time weather data
- [ ] Validate recommendation logic and accuracy
- [ ] Deploy dashboard:
  - Streamlit Cloud / Render for free hosting
  - Configure environment variables and secrets
- [ ] Share link with testers for feedback
- [ ] Prepare presentation/report with key findings
